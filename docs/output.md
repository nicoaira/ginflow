`index/` is published on build runs and contains the selected FAISS, cuVS,
CAGRA, or hnswlib index, plus residue `embeddings.npz` and `records.tsv` so
a later `--query --database` run can align. `seeds/` is published on query
runs. Raw graph, embedding, and window shards are intermediate artifacts and
are published only with their corresponding `--save_*` flag. Raw quantized
window shards are published only with `--save_quantized_windows`.

When the input table has `start` / `end` windows, each window is stored under `{transcript_id}:{start}-{end}` and treated as its own molecule from embeddings onward. See [Sliced graphs](#sliced-graphs).

## graphs_shards/

Published only with `--save_graphs`. Contains one GINFINITY graph shard per
input chunk (`--shard_size` records), in a subdirectory named after the shard
id.

- `*.safetensors` — node/edge tensors (sliced shards also store `residue_index` and `node_roles`)
- `*.json` — identifiers, full source sequences/structures, graph spec, and a content checksum. A sliced row is stored under `{transcript_id}:{start}-{end}`.

## embeddings_shards/

Published only with `--save_embeddings`. Contains per-nucleotide
embeddings from `ginfinity embed-graphs`, one subdirectory per shard.

- `*.npz` — one array per identifier, shape `(L, 128)`, stored as float16 by default. For a slice, `L` is the core window (`end - start`), not the source molecule.
- `*.manifest.json` — package/model versions, device, and record shapes (`core_length`, and `start`/`end` when sliced)

## windows_shards/

Published only with `--save_windows`. Contains sliding windows of the node
embeddings (`--window_size`, default 11, stride 1).

- `*.windows.npz` — one `(n_windows, 1408)` array per `transcript_id` (concatenated, L2-normalized)
- `*.windows.manifest.json` — window size, shapes, and sequences shorter than `w`

## index/

Reusable window index of every database window. Default is exact inner product
(`IndexFlatIP` / `--faiss_index flatip`). `meta.json` records `backend`,
`index_type`, `--quantize`, and graph/IVF parameters. See [indexes.md](indexes.md).

- `index.faiss` — FAISS index (always stored as a CPU index, even after a GPU build)
- `cuvs/` — serialized GPU cuVS CAGRA or IVF-Flat
- `hnsw/` — CPU HNSW converted from uncompressed/SQ CAGRA (`--cagra_to_hnsw`)
- `cagra.index` — custom PQ-CAGRA graph (`--index cagra` with `--quantize pq|opq`)
- `index.bin` — hnswlib custom-distance PQ graph
- `quantization/` — node codebook, SDC table, OPQ rotation, SQ scales, and node codes; for every quantized index this is inside `index/`, not a top-level output
- `windows.tsv` — `faiss_id`, `transcript_id`, `start`, `end`
- `meta.json` — window geometry, model fingerprint, counts, and index settings
- `embeddings.npz` — per-nucleotide embeddings, one array per identifier
- `records.tsv` — `transcript_id`, `sequence`, `secondary_structure`. For a slice the identifier is `{id}:{start}-{end}` and the sequence/structure are the core window (pairs that cross the cut are written as unpaired), so later search/alignment treat that window as its own molecule.
- `evd.json` — Karlin–Altschul λ, K, database residue count, and the reverse-sequence null fit

When node quantization is selected, `index/quantization/` is part of the
reusable database, while the intermediate `windows_quantized/` is published
only with `--save_quantized_windows`. For `--index hnswlib`, these quantized
windows are the CPU centroid-code candidate representation and are not used
by SW. GPU HNSWLIB additionally
stores its int8-scaled original-window CAGRA data inside the serialized index;
the original float16 embeddings above remain authoritative for exact scoring,
SW, alignment, and plots.

`--database` for a later search run should point at this directory.

## seeds/

`seeds/seeds.tsv` contains query-mode hits. Columns: `query_id`, `query_start`,
`query_end`, `target_id`, `target_start`, `target_end`, `score`, `rank`.
Self-hits are kept. With `--exact_rerank true`, scores are original-window
cosine and `--seed_min_similarity` is applied after rerank. Without rerank,
PQ/OPQ writes ADC scores for the top `--seed_k` neighbours (no cosine cutoff).
`seeds/rerank_metrics.json` is published when reranking ran.

`seeds/clusters.tsv` contains diagonal HSP clusters. A cluster starts at the
highest-scoring unused seed and grows by the best remaining seed whose
query/target box is within `--cluster_span` and whose diagonal stays inside
`--cluster_diagonal_tolerance` / `--cluster_max_diagonal_span`. Singletons are
dropped.

`seeds/cluster_members.tsv` lists every seed that went into a cluster.

## alignments.tsv / alignments.txt

GINFINITY-SW local HSPs are first reduced to the highest-scoring non-overlapping set within each query-target pair. This removes duplicate tracebacks produced by overlapping seed-cluster crops before scores are summed. The surviving HSPs are then collapsed by query-target pair and ranked by ascending database E-value. Coordinates are 0-based half-open on the independent subject (the full molecule, or the core window of a slice). Each row reports `total_score` (the sum of disjoint HSP scores), `max_score` (the strongest HSP), `alignment_count`, `evalue` (K m N e^{−λS_total}), and `evalue_pair` (same formula with the target length instead of the full database). The legacy `score` column aliases `total_score`. HSP provenance is retained in `cluster_ids`, `hsp_scores`, and `hsp_spans`; the row also includes the subject `query_sequence` / `query_structure` / `target_sequence` / `target_structure`, and gapped `query_aligned` / `target_aligned` strings for the first HSP. `alignments.txt` contains one pair header followed by the six-line rendering for each surviving HSP.

## report.html

Self-contained search report written on every query run. Open it in a browser: hits are grouped by query, filterable by E-value, and paginated (10 / 25 / 50 / 100 / 150 per page, default 10). The default theme is light; `--report_theme dark` writes a gray-900 page, and a toggle in the masthead switches themes when viewing. The summary table and each hit card show database E, pair E, bits, total score, maximum HSP score, and HSP count, with the aligned span on both molecules. A floating **Back to top** control appears after scrolling and returns to the report header. RNArtistCore and SW plots use a two-column Query | Target (or cosine | SW scores) panel. R4RNA is a single full-width alignment arc plot. The masthead uses `docs/images/ginflow_logo.svg`; the favicon is `docs/images/ginflow_icon.svg`.

## plots/

Published when `--plot_backend` is `rnartistcore`, `r4rna`, or `both`, and/or when `--plot_sw` is set. Each query gets its own draw task. RNArtistCore writes a query SVG and a target SVG per HSP row. R4RNA writes one alignment-coordinate SVG per HSP row (query arcs above, target arcs below, identity ribbon between the backbones). SW plots write a cosine SVG and a score SVG (traceback on the scores). `--plot_max_pairs` (default 25) counts unique query-target pairs per query, not HSP rows or SVG files. Pairs are selected in the same merged-pair total-score order used by `alignments.tsv`, and duplicate/overlapping HSPs are omitted; every surviving HSP in each selected pair is rendered, so the SVG count can be larger than 25. The aligned span, shared pairs, matching bases, and SW path use `--plot_highlight_colour`.

- `plots/rnartistcore/*.svg` — RNArtistCore 2Ds
- `plots/r4rna/*.svg` — R4RNA alignment arc diagrams
- `plots/sw/*.svg` — crop cosine and substitution-score heatmaps

## Sliced graphs

If `structures.tsv` included `start` / `end` columns, every published artifact uses the **expanded** subjects, not the original TSV rows.

| Artifact | What you see for a window `[start, end)` |
|---|---|
| Identifier | `{transcript_id}:{start}-{end}` (full molecules keep the original id) |
| `graphs_shards/*.json` | Full source sequence/structure; the graph node set is core + optional pairing context (only with `--save_graphs`) |
| `embeddings_shards/*.npz` | One `(end - start, 128)` array — core nucleotides only (only with `--save_embeddings`) |
| `windows_shards/*` | Sliding 11-nt seeds over that core embedding (only with `--save_windows`) |
| `index/records.tsv` | Core sequence and a pair-closed core structure (crossing pairs become `.`) |
| `index/windows.tsv`, `seeds/seeds.tsv`, `alignments.tsv` | Coordinates are 0-based on the core: `0` is `sequence[start]`, not the 5′ end of the source RNA |

Two overlapping windows on the same source row (`34,40` / `90,95`) appear as two ids, two embeddings, and two query groups in `report.html`. How to write the table: [usage.md — Sliced graphs](usage.md#sliced-graphs).
